# CURRENT
  * Config Webpack
  * Config Project Structure

# TODOs
  * unrelated to this project, but someday find a way to auto-increment package.json version when pushing to git

# NOTES
To develop, edit files in src, build with webpack.
dist are files sent by server.  I think I'm misunderstanding this.

Background files we need for functionality, but don't want to (explicitly) expose to the client (e.g. js libraries) go in "physics"
